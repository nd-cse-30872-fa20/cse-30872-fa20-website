    [Batman] is an **atypical** "superhero".  Unlike [Spider-man], [Batman] has
    no special powers (unless you count being _filthy_ _rich_ a superpower).
    That said, he is, for better or worse, greatly respected for being a
    crime-fighter by his many fans.  Despite his dour demeanor, [Batman] at
    times displays moments of humor and periodically manifests his modest
    intellect.

    In this programming challenge, [Batman] is locked in a battle of wits with
    the [Riddler].  Once again, the green supervillain has a mind-bending,
    brain-teasing challenge for the masked avenger:
    
    > Find all the pairs of `5`-digit numbers that use the digits `0` through
    `9` once each, such that the first number divided by the second is equal to
    some integer `N`, where `N` is between `2` and `100` (inclusive).  
    
    That is, given the digits `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` and a number `N`,
    find all permutations of these digits such that:

        :::text
        abcde / fghij = N

    where each letter represents a different digit.  The first digit of one of
    the numerals is allowed to be `0`.

    Because [Batman] lacks any significant superpower (besides money), he begs
    that you help him defeat the [Riddler] by using your [programming superpowers].

    ## Input

    Each line of input consists of a valid integer `N`.  An input of `0`
    terminates the program (no output should be displayed for it).

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        61
        62
        0

    ## Output

    The program should display **ALL** pairs of numerals that match the
    description above.  The numerators should be sorted by increasing numerator
    and denominator and displayed in the following format:

        :::text
        XXXXX / XXXXX = N
        XXXXX / XXXXX = N
        ...

    If there are no pairs of numerals satisfying the atypical division
    condition, then the program should display: "There are no solutions for N".

    Separate the output for two different values of `N` by a blank line.

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        There are no solutions for 61.

        79546 / 01283 = 62
        94736 / 01528 = 62

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-fa20-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git checkout master                       # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git checkout -b challenge07               # Create and checkout challenge07 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge07/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge07/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "challenge07: done"         # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge07            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/submit.py` script or [curl]:

        :::bash
        $ .scripts/submit.py
        Submitting challenge07 assignment ...
        Submitting challenge07 code ...
          Result Success
           Score 6.00
            Time 0.11

        $ curl -F source=@challenge07/program.cpp https://dredd.h4x0r.space/code/cse-30872-fa20/challenge07
