    Before deciding going to [CMU] for graduate school, [Cat] was considering
    selling out and getting a real job out in industry.  To do so, however, she had
    to pass the dreaded programming interviews.  In one of her first interviews,
    she faced the following problem:

    > Given a length `N` and a count `K`, generate all the binary strings with
    exactly `K` `1`'s. Â You will need to support binary strings of `1 <= N <=
    16`.

    Being a **noob** at the time [^1], she failed and didn't pass the interview
    [^2].  Her failure on this interview question haunts her to this day [^3].

    This is your opportunity to show that you are just as good as a [CMU]
    graduate student and solve this problem for [Cat] once and for all.

    [^1]:       She is still a noob. <3.
    [^2]:       Should have taken Programming Challenges... oh wait... ~RIP~.
    [^3]:       Just like the time she casted a *string* into a *double* in Systems Programming. **SMH**

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of inputs where each line specifies `N` (length
    of binary string) and `K` (the number of `1`s in the binary string):

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        4 3
        4 4

    ## Output

    For each pair of `N` and `K` inputs, print out all the binary strings with
    length `N` that contain exactly `K` `1`s.  If there is more than one binary
    string, then display them in lexigraphical order.

    **Note**: Separate test cases by placing a blank line **between** them as
    shown below.
    </div>

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        0111
        1011
        1101
        1110

        1111

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-fa20-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git checkout master                       # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git checkout -b challenge09               # Create and checkout challenge09 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge09/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge09/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "challenge09: done"         # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge09            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/submit.py` script or [curl]:

        :::bash
        $ .scripts/submit.py
        Submitting challenge09 assignment ...
        Submitting challenge09 code ...
          Result Success
           Score 6.00
            Time 0.52

        $ curl -F source=@challenge09/program.cpp https://dredd.h4x0r.space/code/cse-30872-fa20/challenge09
        {"result": "Success", "score": 6, "time": 0.5163395404815674}
